# HTML Display

Very simple plugin allowing you to put the HTML / javascript / Css code you want on its equipment tile.

>**IMPORTANT**
>
>The plugin needs to know how to code in HTML, Javascript and CSS, no support will be provided by the Jeedom team on the code of your widget.

Use cases can be :

- unique menu for designs
- inclusion of outside information at Jeedom

>**IMPORTANT**
>
>As a reminder, the designs ALWAYS use the dashboard version of the code (whether on mobile or desktop)
